# DigitalSignage
Digital Signage on a piZero 2W

## Intro
Weekend vibe code project that I plan to later go back use it as an opportunity to learn more about web developement, refacotoring it and getting into how things are working.

## What this does
This provides a digital signage that displays two equally sized panels from a RaspberryPi Zero W2.  It hosts a management portal with a login that allows an admin to upload photos, delete photos, and change the time between picture rotation on each side.

## Future
I plan to make a guide for setup as well as a chef script (or something comprable) to configure the pi OS to work as a plug and play signage.
